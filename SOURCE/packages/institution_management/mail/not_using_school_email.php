  <body>
    Dear {$username},<br /><br />

    Thank you for your recent request to set up your school {$schoolName} as an institution in Cambridge GO.<br /><br />

    Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to process your request, because we have been unable to verify that your email address is associated with the school. We cross-check all school applications by internet search in order to ensure that they are genuine.<br /><br />

    If you have used a generic email address, please restart your application by registering in Cambridge GO using an official school email account.<br /><br />

    If you are unable to do this (for example if you have no school email account) please contact <a href="mailto: educs@cambridge.org">educs@cambridge.org</a> and we can re-evaluate your request.<br /><br />

    Many thanks,<br />
    The Cambridge GO team<br /><br />
