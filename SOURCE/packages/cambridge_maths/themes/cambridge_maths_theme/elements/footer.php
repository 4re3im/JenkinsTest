                    <p>
                        An Authorised User will be provided with an access code that will need to be registered to an individual email address. Once registered, the Authorised User will have access to specific content on Cambridge HOTmaths. The Subscriber warrants that all information
                        contained in the Application is true and acknowledges that it is their responsibility to advise HOTmaths within seven (7) days of that information changing in any way including, but not limited to, updating email addresses by means
                        of the relevant link.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Subscriber will take, and where applicable will ensure that the user takes, all reasonable steps to prevent the Subscriber/User's password becoming known to any other person. The Subscriber will advise Cambridge University Press or HOTmaths immediately
                        if the Subscriber or the User becomes aware of any unauthorised use of the password.
                    </p>

                        Subject to clause 4 below, the Subscriber acknowledges that the Site Material is the property of Cambridge University Press and/or HOTmaths and is copyright &copy; Cambridge University Press or Cambridge HOTmaths or published under exclusive license from
                        the copyright holder by Cambridge University Press. Except as permitted by law or these Terms of Use, the Subscriber will not, and where applicable the Subscriber will procure that the User will not, allow any other person to use
                        the Site or reproduce or otherwise transmit any of the Site Material in any way whatsoever without first obtaining the written permission of HOTmaths or Cambridge University Press. HOTmaths reserves its entitlements under Part

                        A Teacher, or a User who is a teacher, may use Site Material for classroom instructional purposes such as projecting it onto a whiteboard, displaying it by means of other electronic media or printing it and distributing it to their students. Site Material
                        also may be downloaded to digital media for use within a school by Subscribers but must be immediately removed upon expiry of the subscription unless renewal is pending. The use of the Site Materials by a Teacher, or by a User
                        who is a teacher, for any purpose other than the instruction of the students in their class at a time when their right to use the Site Materials is current or in the process of renewal, will constitute a breach of these Terms of
                        Use
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Subscriber will indemnify HOTmaths and/or Cambridge University Press for any loss or damage sustained by it as a result of any breach of these Terms of Use by the Subscriber, including the Subscriber's obligations in respect of the activities of the
                        User. The Subscriber acknowledges that circumstances may exist where damages are not an appropriate remedy and Cambridge University Press/HOTmaths are entitled to obtain injunctive relief.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cambridge University Press and/or HOTmaths may terminate this agreement immediately if at any time the Subscriber is in breach of the Subscriber's obligations (including as a result of some act or omission by the User). The Subscriber acknowledges that
                        termination for any reason will not entitle the Subscriber to a refund of any payments made to Cambridge University Press or HOTmaths prior to the date of such termination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cambridge University Press or HOTmaths will refund Subscriber payments upon receipt of a written submission from the Subscriber that the site does not deliver that which it claims to provide. Refunds will not be given where the Subscriber is using systems
                        other than those identified in the 'System requirements' or where the Subscriber is misusing the system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cambridge University Press and HOTmaths reserve the right to alter their product and pricing systems at any time.
